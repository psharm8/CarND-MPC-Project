## Rubric Points
**The Model**

The model uses vehicle's state which includes x and y coordinates, orientation (psi), velocity, cross track error (cte) and psi error (epsi) and outputs the steering angle and speed to closely follow a given path.

The model uses a 3rd degree polynomial fitted over provided waypoints and calculates the steering angle and throttle value using the actuation values from previous step and current state of the car. It uses an optimiser to minimize the cost which includes cte, epsi, change in speed and change in steering.
These values need to be tuned for the car to follow a smooth/optimal path. 


The equations used in the model are:

**Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)**

The values chosen for N and dt are 12 and 0.1.

The value for dt is chosen 0.1 sec because it helps in accounting for the latency of 100ms which is fixed in this project.

The value of 12 for number of steps was just enough to cover the waypoints provided at every step. Reduction in number of points led to erratic movement of the car, whereas too many steps tried to fit the projected path for a longer distance which would eventually be invalidated due to the approximate solutions, it also increases the computation time.

**Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing**

At every time step a list of waypoints are provided (in world coordinates). These waypoints are transformed into car's coordinate system and then a 3rd degree polynomial is fitted.
The preprocessing of waypoints helps in computation and returning the projected points (which are expected in cars frame of reference) as the car's coordinate systems means that car would always be at origin.

**Model Predictive Control with Latency**

Latency is handled in a very simple way; given the latency of 100 ms which is same as the timestep interval, the actuation state to be used as previous state changed from (t-1) to (t-2) because the actuation from step (t-2) would take affect at step (t-1) due to the latency, which makes it the last actuation state for time (t).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
